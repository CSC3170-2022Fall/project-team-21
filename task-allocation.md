## Message to our team members from the group leader
This is Li Jiaqi writing to our teammates, here are some things you need to be cautious about out when collaborating in our group project, and the things that we should do to make our project better.

- Because we're **collaborating** instead of working on your own, please synchronize this git repository from time to time by using a `git pull`, or just click on the "synchronize" button at the left bar of vscode.

- Please write good commit message, clearly indicating what you've done. Do not commit unnecessary files or temporary files.


There are several timelines everyone should keep in mind:
- By December 4 23:30 pm we should submit:
    - Project abstract
    - Progress Report
- By December 11 23:30 pm:
    - Submit slides in presentation
    - Apply for presentation time slot
    - Upload video demo of our program
- By December 24 23:30 pm:
